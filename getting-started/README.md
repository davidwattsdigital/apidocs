# Getting Started

The iVvy API allows apps to integrate directly with the iVvy product suite. Some typical use cases include:

* Connecting a Customer Relationship Manager with iVvy
* Connecting a Point of Sale System to iVvy Venues
* Pushing Availability, Rates & Inventory into iVvy Venues through a Central Reservation System or Property Management System
* Connecting an Accounting Package with iVvy Events or Venues

The API described in this document follows an RPC \(Remote Procedure Call\) paradigm. Each RPC method is grouped into a few higher level namespaces to help organise this document in a more logical manner.

iVvy takes security very seriously and the API described in this document has been designed to be as secure as possible.

* All transport has been secured by utilising industry standard TLS
* Key generation can be done first authenticating with the iVvy backend system
* All requests must be signed using the key/secret pair to prove the request was made by a valid key
* All requests have a time limit to avoid future replay attacks

To help you get started we offer sdk libraries in [C\#](https://github.com/ivvycode/ivvy-sdk-net),  and [Javascript](https://github.com/ivvycode/ivvy-sdk-js).
